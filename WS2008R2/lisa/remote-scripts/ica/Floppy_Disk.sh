# Description:
#     This script was created to automate the testing of a Linux
#     Integration services.This script detects the floppy disk    
#     and performs read, write and delete operations on the   
#     Floppy disk.
#     Steps:
#	  1. Make sure that a floppy disk (.vfd) is attached to 
#        the Diskette drive
#	  2. Mount the Floppy Disk. 
#     3. Create a file named Sample.txt on the Floppy Disk
#     4. Read the file created on the Floppy Disk 
#	  5. Delete the file created on the Floppy Disk.
#     6. Unmount the Floppy Disk.
