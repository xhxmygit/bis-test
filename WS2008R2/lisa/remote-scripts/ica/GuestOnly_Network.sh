# Description:
#     This script was created to automate the testing of a Linux
#     Integration services.
#     This script is used to verify that the Guest Only network 
#     adapter of the Guest VM cannot communicate with the 
#     External Network ,Internal Network
#     and can communicate only with other VM's Guest Only 
#     network.
#     Steps:
#	  1. Make sure we were given a configuration file with         
#         REPOSITORY SERVER , HOST INTERNAL NETWORK IP  and 
#	     VM_GUEST_ONLY_IP
#	  2. Disable all the legacy network adapters present in
#          the VM.(We are doing this step because of bug ID:132)
#	  3. Ping the Guest Only network of other VM through the 
# 	     Synthetic Network Adapter card .
#      4. Ping the Internal network of the HOST through the 
# 	     Synthetic Network Adapter card .(This should fail)
#      5. Ping the External network through the 
# 	     Synthetic Network Adapter card .(This should fail)
#      6. Enable all the legacy network adapters present in the 
#         VM.
#	 To identify objects to compare with, we source a 
#     constansts file
#     This file will be given to us from 
#     Hyper-V Host server.  
#     It contains definitions like:
#         REPOSITORY SERVER="10.200.41.67"
#         HOST_SERVER_INTERNAL_IP=152.168.0.1
#	     VM_GUEST_ONLY_IP=152.168.0.3
