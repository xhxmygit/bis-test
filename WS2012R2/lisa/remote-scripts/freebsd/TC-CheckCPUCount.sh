# Check that the guest sees the correct number of CPUs.
# This script will read the number of CPUs it should see
# from the file constants.sh.  This file will define a
# variable named VCPU as follows:
#    VCPU=2
#
# This definition lets the test script know that it should
# see two CPUs.  If true, this script indicates the test
# case passed.  Otherwise, a failing test case is indicated.
